                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>At Sakura Sushi, we believe in the simple fundamental principles of the Japanese culinary tradition. High-quality ingredients from reputable suppliers. Sushi that is bold in its simplicity. A well-crafted piece of artistry. A free reign for the natural flavors. No unnecessary disruptions.</p>
                <p>Sakura Sushi, founded by the visionary chef Kenji Tanaka in 1984, moved to Trondheim from Osaka, Japan in 2011 to expand his testament to his lifelong passion for sushi craftsmanship. Each dish that leaves the kitchen is a testament to his dedication and mastery of the art of sushi making. Today there is 8 locations in Norway.</p>
                <p>Our client doesn't just serve sushi; they curate an experience. As soon as you step inside, the ambiance takes you on a journey to Japan. The warm, dimly lit interior is adorned with cherry blossom motifs and traditional Japanese decor, creating an atmosphere that's both intimate and inviting.</p>
